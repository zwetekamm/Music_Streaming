# Music_Streaming

This is credited to a Udemy course by Reece Kenney on how to create a music streaming service; https://www.udemy.com/spotify-clone

Although it is not entirely my own, I've posted it because music streaming is a keen interest of mine and Reece's course was outstandingly helpful. This was the largest project I had attempted at the time. Prior to the course, I had basic experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while none with PHP and MySQL.

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
Services: Apache and MySQL
